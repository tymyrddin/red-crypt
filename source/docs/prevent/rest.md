# Data at rest

* Full disk encryption ensures malicious users cannot access the data on a lost drive without the necessary logins.
* In addition to protecting data in transit, DLP solutions can search for and locate sensitive data on networks and 
block access for certain users. These controls are only valid while the data is at rest. Once it is accessed or moved, 
DLP protections for the other states of data will apply.
* Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) allow for DLP policies to information stored and shared in the cloud. This 
includes back-end systems and collaboration platforms. The mechanism of a CASB is similar to that of a DLP, with 
policies and functionality tailored to a cloud environment.
* Mobile device management (MDM) is an increasingly popular way to manage the data on these devices. MDM tools 
limit data access to applications, block devices that fall into the wrong hands, and encrypt any data it contains.
