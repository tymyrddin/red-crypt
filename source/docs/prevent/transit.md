# Data in transit

* Network security tools like firewalls and authentication are simple and often effective defences against 
malicious attacks and intrusions.
* Data protection technologies exist that include automated policies that block malicious files, prompt users when 
they are at risk and automatically encrypt data before it is in transit. This helps manage a growing volume of 
email attachments, removable drives and file transfers.
* Encrypting email ensures its contents are unreadable and that any attachments are encrypted too, but not the sender 
or the subject, but in general, encryption can be applied to email delivery, directory sync and journaling, helping 
with both increasing security and classification.
* A data loss prevention (DLP) solution can help avoid the loss of sensitive information. DLPs scan all emails 
and their attachments, identify potential leaks based on policies based on keywords, file hashes, pattern matching 
and dictionaries. Suspicious emails can then be blocked, quarantined for review or sent via a secure messaging portal, 
depending on policies.
