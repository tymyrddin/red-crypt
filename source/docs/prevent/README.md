# Introduction

## What?

Protect data in its three states.

## Why?

* Data left unencrypted or unprotected is at risk. Whether the risk is acceptable or not, depends on
the nature of the information.
* Reactive protection does not work: Once data is breached, the task shifts from protection to risk management to 
damage control.

## How?

* [Data in transit](transit.md)
* [Data at rest](rest.md)
* [Data in use](use.md)
