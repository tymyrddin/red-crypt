# Data in use

* Put protections for data in use before anyone can access the information. Once a sensitive document has been 
compromised, there is no way to control what an adversary does with the data.
* Identity theft is still on the rise, especially with more people sharing more of their data online. Identity 
management solutions help ensure users are who they say they are before they access any information.
* Whether with digital rights protection, information rights management (IRM) or another method, use authorisation 
solutions to limit the actions someone can take with the data they access.
