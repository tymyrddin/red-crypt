# Introduction

## What?

Attempt to bypass the security of a cryptographic system by discovering weaknesses and flaws in cryptography techniques, cryptographic protocol, encryption algorithms, or key management strategy. 

## Why?

* Obtain unauthorised access to sensitive data or information by intercepting or eavesdropping on general communication. In this situation, the data and the communication remain intact and are not tampered with. 
* Modify the data or communication to gains access to it and tamper with it.

## How?

* [Brute force attack](brute-force.md)
* [Ciphertext-only attack](ciphertext-only.md)
* [Chosen plaintext attack](plaintext.md)
* [Chosen ciphertext attack](ciphertext.md)
* [Known plaintext attack](known-plaintext.md)
* [Key and algorithm](algorithm.md)
* [Side-channel attack](side-channel.md)
* [Physical attack](physical.md)
