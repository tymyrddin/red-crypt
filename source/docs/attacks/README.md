# Introduction

## What?

Attempt to bypass the security of a cryptographic system by discovering weaknesses and flaws in cryptography 
techniques, cryptographic protocol, encryption algorithms, or key management strategy. 

## Why?

* Obtain unauthorised access to sensitive data or information by intercepting or eavesdropping on general communication. 
In this situation, the data and the communication remain intact and are not tampered with. 
* Modify the data or communication to gains access to it and tamper with it.

## How?

* [Chosen plaintext attack](plaintext.md)
* [Chosen ciphertext attack](ciphertext.md)
* [Unknown key share attack](unknown-key.md)
* [Forgery attack](forgery.md)
* [Impersonation attack (Group message)](group-impersonation.md)
* [Side-channel attack](side-channel.md)
* [Read a PGP encrypted message](pgp.md)
