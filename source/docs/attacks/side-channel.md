# Side-channel attack

A side-channel attack (SCA) is a security exploit that involves collecting information about what a computing device 
does when it is performing cryptographic operations.

## How it works

1. Monitor the emissions produced by electronic circuits when the target's computer is being used to exploit information about power consumption and electromagnetic fields for reverse engineering (side-channel attack) (OR)
2. Use the sounds a central processing unit (CPU) produces (acoustic attack) (OR)
3. Exploits how and when cache is accessed (cache attack) (OR)
4. Use information by introducing faults into the systemâ€™s computations (differential fault analysis attack) (OR)
5. Monitor the movement of data to and from a system's CPU and memory (timing attack, 
    for example AES side-channel attack) (OR)
6. Use infrared images to monitor the surface of a CPU chip (thermal-imaging attack) (OR)
7. Collect information about hard disk activity by using a audio/visual recorder (optical side-channel attack) (OR)
8. Monitor the electromagnetic fields produced by data as it moves through the computer (Van Eck phreaking)

## Challenges

* Side Channel - AES : CPA 
* Side Channel - AES : first round

## Remediation

* Randomise the order of operations on data within the system to make it more difficult for an adversary.
* Increase the amount of noise in a channel.
* Faraday cages can also be used to reduce electromagnetic leaks. This is akin to wearing aluminium hats.
