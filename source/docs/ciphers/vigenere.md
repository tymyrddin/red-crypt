# Poly-alphabetic substitution: Vigenère

[RootMe Challenge: Polyalphabetic substitution: Vigenère](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Cryptanalysis/Polyalphabetic-substitution-Vigenere): We need your expert opinion on this document. This is an old letter and it appears that it is important for the pirates that we are searching for. Your mission is to decipher the text and give us the full name of the author (example : "John Doe").

## Poly-alphabetic substitution

Multi-alphabet substitution uses multiple substitutions, so that, for example, an `a` in the plaintext is sometimes a `k` and sometimes a `j` in the ciphertext. 

## Vigenère

Perhaps the most widely known multi-alphabet cipher is the Vigenère cipher. This cipher was described in 1553 by Giovan Battista Bellaso, but was misattributed to nineteenth century cryptographer Blaise de Vigenère. It is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different mono-alphabet ciphers selected based on the letters of a keyword. Bellaso also added the concept of using any keyword, thereby making the choice of substitution alphabets difficult to calculate.

For many years, Vigenère was considered very strong, even unbreakable. In the nineteenth century, Friedrich Kasiski published a technique for breaking the Vigenère cipher.
