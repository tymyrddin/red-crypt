# Mono-alphabetic substitution: Caesar

[RootMe Challenge: Monoalphabetic substitution - Caesar](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Cryptanalysis/Monoalphabetic-substitution-Caesar): We just caught the messenger of the Emperor. He transmitted a coded message to his son. This could be an important message. Youâ€™ve to decrypt it ! To validate, you must enter the concatenation of the first letters of each line followed by the concatenation of the last letters of each line (for example : `tfhqdlhfpkmeokgq`).

I used [Hack Caesar 26](https://github.com/tymyrddin/scripts-classical-ciphers/tree/main/caesar/caesar_hack26.py) and a pattern and poem emerged.
