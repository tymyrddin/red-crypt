# Introduction

## What?

Data at rest in information technology means data that is housed physically on computer data storage in any digital form: data on a PC, laptop, pad or mobile device, server, cloud storage, file hosting services, databases, data warehouses, spreadsheets, archives, tapes, etc.

Data at rest can be password protected, encoded, encrypted, tokenized, federated, etc

## Why?

While data in transit is easier to hack, data at rest is more valuable than data in transit because it often has a higher level of sensitive information. And just because data is at rest does not mean it is not moving. Many data breaches happen due to a lost USB drive or laptop.
