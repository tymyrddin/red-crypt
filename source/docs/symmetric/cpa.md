# Side channel AES: CPA

[RootMe Challenge: Side Channel - AES: CPA](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Cryptanalysis/Side-Channel-AES-CPA): We performed 200 measurements of the power consumption of a cryptographic device during the encryption of a random text (PTI). The corresponding cipher (CTO) was also saved during the operation. Find the AES key that was used.

Note: Values have been normalized to reduce data size.
