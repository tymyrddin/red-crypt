# Introduction

## What?

Symmetric encryption is at the foundation of all modern secure communications. It is what is used to "scramble" messages so that people can only decrypt them if they have access to the same key used to encrypt them. AES is a pretty good place to start.

## Why?

AES is used in many common Internet protocols and operating system services, including TLS (used by HTTPS), IPSec, and file-level or full-disk encryption. Given its ubiquity, it is one of the most important ciphers to know how to use properly and the principles of correct use of AES transfer easily to correct use of other ciphers.
