# Introduction

## What?

ECC is more powerful and efficient than alternatives like RSA and classical Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECC with a 256-bit key is stronger than RSA with a 4096-bit key), and it is also more complex.

## Why?

This topic is filled with fiddly parameters, subtle pitfalls, and breathtaking logic. The beauty of which I *have* to explore and exerience.
