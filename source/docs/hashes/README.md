# Introduction

## What?

Hashing is a cornerstone of cryptographic security. It involves the concept of a one-way function or fingerprint. Hash functions only work well when a couple of things are true about them:

* They produce repeatable, unique values for every input.
* The output value provides no clues about the input that produced it.

## Why?

Some hashing functions are better at satisfying these requirements than others. How they work and why choosing a good one is so terribly important.

## How?

* [DCC Hash](dcc.md)
* [DCC2 Hash](dcc2.md)
* [LM Hash](lm.md)
* [Message Digest 5](md5.md)
* [NT Hash](nt.md)
* [SHA-2 Hash](sha2.md)
* [CISCO Salted password](cisco.md)
* [SHA-3 Hash](sha3.md)
