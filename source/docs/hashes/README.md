# Introduction

## What?

Hashing is a cornerstone of cryptographic security. It involves the concept of a one-way function or fingerprint. Hash functions only work well when a couple of things are true about them:

* They produce repeatable, unique values for every input. 
* The output value provides no clues about the input that produced it.

## Why?

Some hashing functions are better at satisfying these requirements than others. How they work and why choosing a good one is so terribly important.
