# Introduction

## What?

Hashing is a cornerstone of cryptographic security. It involves the concept of a one-way function or fingerprint. Hash functions only work well when a couple of things are true about them:

- [x] They produce repeatable, unique values for every input.
- [x] The output value provides no clues about the input that produced it.

## Why?

Some hashing functions are better at satisfying these requirements than others. How they work and why choosing a good one is so terribly important.

## How?

- [x] [DCC2 Hash](dcc2.md)
- [x] [LM Hash](lm.md)
- [x] [Message Digest 5](md5.md)
- [x] [NT Hash](nt.md)
- [x] [SHA-2 Hash](sha2.md)
- [x] [CISCO Salted password](cisco.md)
- [ ] [SHA-3 Hash](sha3.md)
