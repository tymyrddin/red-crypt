# Introduction

## What?

Encryption algorithms or implementations thereof can fail to protect confidentiality in many ways. This can be due to a failure to match the security requirements or to set requirements matching reality. 

## Why?

Many engineers do not even think about cryptographic security requirements and just want to be "secure" without understanding what that actually means. A recipe for disaster.
