# RSA Decipher oracle

[RootMe Challenge: Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Cryptanalysis/RSA-Decipher-Oracle): You have sucessfully intercepted a `C` text, encrypted with a RSA keypair which you know the `(n, e)` public component.

Luckily, your victim has made a mistake by using a server that allows you to decrypt any ciphered text with his public key, except for those including a secret that must stay encrypted.

Your job is to handle it in order to decrypt this weird message!
